This RT extension allows your RT 3.6 instance to verify GPG signatures on incoming mail.

To use the GPG signature verification, you need to do the following:

Set up a gnupg key directory with a pubring containing only the keys
you care about and specify the following in your SiteConfig.pm

Set($RT::GPGKeyDir, "/path/to/keyring-directory");
@RT::MailPlugins = qw(Auth::MailFrom Filter::SimpleGPGVerify);

You'll also want to have a configuration file (gpg.conf) that looks like this in your GPG keyring directory:

 keyserver pgp.mit.edu
  keyserver-options honor-http-proxy,auto-key-retrieve
